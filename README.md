# QuickBite

This is a food delivery app that matches users who are at the same location to split the delivery fee. At the moment, our domain of users are apartment/dorm residents at the University of South Florida (USF). This can be easily scaled for users and other multi-family residential communities. We used the Kivy framework to design the frontend and handle use data. We stored this data in a SQL database. 

This application improves the quality of life for students and lower income residents by reducing the budget takeout. 

In future, we would like to add more menu and restaurant options, expand our user domain, and improve the UI. We also aim to add a budget tracker option for students to monitor their expenses and plan their budget effciently. 

We belive this service can benefit marginalizd communities with lower income and help people build relationships with residents in their communites.
